<p>Greetings! Jesse T. Ellis here! 👋🏼</p>

<p>I’m a full stack developer with over 4 years of experience in development and operations. I have 3 years of experience maintaining and advancing a statewide longitudinal data linkage system. I enjoy working with diverse multidisciplinary teams to help realize a larger vision. I have worked with academic institutions, non-profit organizations and start-up tech companies. My passion for computer science and self-learning began when I was young. I always approach my work with curiosity, respect and an open mind.</p>

<p>Some things I’m currently working with or would like to work with again are JavaScript, Python, C & C++, HTML & CSS, React, Web Components, XState & statecharts, Adobe Illustrator & XD, GIS, PostgreSQL, virtualization and system security.</p>

<p>Extracurriculars I get excited about include vegan cooking, running, biking, watching something from The Criterion Collection and civic engagement through Code for America. I also have 3 dogs that are probably staring at me as we speak.</p>
